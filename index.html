            <p>Slate is a simple theme that I created for the GitHub Pages automatic
                generator. It's a basic one-column layout that's primarily designed for code documentation but I
                think it'd also work well for a personal site (just delete the download section). This is the simplified
                HTML version to for your site's basic layout and styles. Clone these files and replace this content to
                get the ball rolling.</p>

                <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I
                    could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
                    the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to
                    come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

                <p>I don't want to sound like
                    I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you
                    just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
                    as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
